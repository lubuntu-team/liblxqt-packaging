# - Find the lxqt include and library dirs and define a some macros
#
# The module defines the following variables
#
#  LXQT_FOUND         - Set to TRUE if all of the above has been found
#
#  LXQT_INCLUDE_DIR   - The lxqt include directory
#
#  LXQT_INCLUDE_DIRS  - The lxqt and the Qt include directory, for use with INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES()
#
#  LXQT_LIBRARY_DIRS  - The lxqt and the Qt library directories
#
#  LXQT_LIBRARIES     - The libraries needed to use lxqt
#
#  LXQT_SHARE_DIR     - This allows to install and read the configs from non-standard locations
#
#  LXQT_TRANSLATIONS_DIR - The default translations directory
#
#  LXQT_ETC_XDG_DIR   - XDG standards expects system-wide configuration files in the
#                        /etc/xdg/lxqt location. Unfortunately QSettings we are using internally
#                        can be overriden in the Qt compilation time to use different path for
#                        system-wide configs. (for example configure ... -sysconfdir /etc/settings ...)
#                        This path can be found calling Qt4's qmake:
#                             qmake -query QT_INSTALL_CONFIGURATION
#
# LXQT_USE_FILE       - The variable LXQT_USE_FILE is set which is the path to a CMake file that
#                        can be included to compile lxqt applications and libraries. It sets up
#                        the compilation environment for include directories and populates a
#                        LXQT_LIBRARIES variable.
#
# When using the components argument, LXQT_USE_* variables are automatically set
# for the LXQT_USE_FILE to pick up.  If one wishes to manually set them, the
# available ones to set include:
#               LXQT_USE_MOUNT
#               LXQT_USE_GLOBAL_KEY_CLIENT
#
# Typical usage could be something like:
#   set(LXQT_USE_MOUNT 1)
#   find_package(LXQT REQUIRED)
#   include(${LXQT_USE_FILE})
#
#   lxqt_translate_ts(QM_FILES
#     SOURCES
#        ${H_FILES}
#        ${CPP_FILES}
#        ${UI_FILES}
#   )
#   lxqt_translate_desktop(DESKTOP_FILES
#     SOURCES
#        ${DESKTOP_FILES_IN}
#  )
#
#   add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
#   target_link_libraries(myexe $LXQT_LIBRARIES})
